# STATS 32

This repository contains material that I created for Stanford's STATS 32: Introduction to R for Undergraduates. Iâ€™ve taught this course twice now, in Fall 2017/2018 & 2018/2019. Both times, the course met for 8 80-min sessions over 4 weeks. While mostly original, the content was heavily inspired by [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

It's difficult to recreate the order in which I covered the material in class. Some days I would go through the slides first before the code, other times I would be switching between the two (or even skipping over the slides, leaving it as reference). Nevertheless, for those interested in following the material, you can read the Pres file first before the Code file.
