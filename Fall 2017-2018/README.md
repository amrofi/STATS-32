# STATS-32-Fall-2017-18

This repository contains material for the Fall 2017-18 run of Stanford's STATS 32: Introduction to R for Undergraduates. The course met for 8 80-min sessions over 4 weeks.

In some cases, I did not get to go through all the material I prepared and had to push some over to the next session. I have not edited the material to reflect this.
