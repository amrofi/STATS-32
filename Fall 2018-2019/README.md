# STATS-32-Fall-2018-19

This repository contains material for the Fall 2018-19 run of Stanford's STATS 32: Introduction to R for Undergraduates. The course met for 8 80-min sessions over 4 weeks. You can access the course website [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~kjytay/courses/32-2018/).

In this run of the course, I gave optional programming questions for those who wanted to practice more on their own. I have just included the questions here, not the solutions.
