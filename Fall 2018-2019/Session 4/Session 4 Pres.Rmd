# Recap of session 3: data visualization

- Different types of plots for visualizing different types of variables
- Grammar of graphics for `ggplot2`
    - Essential elements: **data**, **geom**etries, **aes**thetics  
    - **Layers** allow us to build more complex plots  

# `ggplot2` syntax

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)

```

# Agenda for today
- Transforming data with `dplyr` (and `%>%` syntax)  

# Why do we need to transform data?  
We rarely get data in exactly the form we need!  

- Need to create new variables or summaries  
- Need to rename or reorder variables  

Transforming data in R is made easy by the `dplyr` package ("official" cheat sheet available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)).

# The 5 basic `dplyr` verbs

- `select()`: pick variables by their names
- `mutate()`: create new variables based on existing ones
- `arrange()`: reorder rows
- `filter()`: pick observations by their values
- `summarize()`: collapse many values down to a single summary

# Toy example: Student scores
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
scores <- data.frame(Name = c("Andrew", "John", "Mary", "Jane", "Bob", "Dan"),
                     English = c(60, 66, 92, 80, 80, 58),
                     Math = c(96, 55, 63, 76, 80, 52),
                     Science = c(80, 56, 70, 89, 82, 79),
                     History = c(56, 64, 62, 55, 48, 90),
                     Spanish = c(77, 77, 98, 40, 50, 61),
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
scores
```

# `select`: pick subset of variables/columns by name

1. Take the `scores` dataset.  
2. **Select** the Name and History columns.  

# `mutate`: create new columns based on old ones

Form teacher: "What are their total scores?"  

1. Take the `scores` dataset.

Form teacher: "Can I have the students in order of overall performance?"  

1. Take the `scores` dataset.  
2. **Arrange** rows by the Total column.

Form teacher: "No no, better students on top please..."  

1. Take the `scores` dataset.  
2. **Arrange** rows by the Total column, but in descending order.  

# `arrange`: reorder rows

Form teacher: "Can I have them in descending order of total scores, but if students tie, then by alphabetical order?"  

1. Take the `scores` dataset.  
2. **Arrange** rows first by the Total column in descending order, then by the Name column (in ascending order).  

# `filter`: pick observations by their values

1. Take the `scores` dataset.  
2. **Summarize** the dataset by taking the mean of the Science column and the standard deviation of the science column.  

# `group_by`: use `dplyr` verbs on a group-by-group basis  

Academic: "I want to know if the boys scored better than the girls in Spanish"  

1. Take the `scores` dataset.  
2. **Group** the dataset rows by gender (assuming there is a gender column).  
3. **Summarize** each group of the dataset by taking the mean of the Spanish column.

# More on filters  

Other ways to make comparisons:  

- `>`: greater than  
- `<`: less than  
- `>=`: greater than or equal to  
- `<=`: less than or equal to  
- `!=`: not equal to  
- `==`: equal to (**Do not use `=` to test for equality!!**)  

Combining comparisons:  

- `!`: not  
- `&`: and  
- `|`: or

# `transmute`: create new columns based on old ones, discard old ones

Form teacher: "I just want the mean score for each student"
```{r eval = FALSE}
scores %>% 
    transmute(mean = (English + Math + Science + History + Spanish) / 5)
```

# TRUE/FALSE statements

How does R understand the code `filter(History < 60)`?

- R checks each row of the dataset: is `History` less than 60 or not?
    - `History < 60` is a statement that is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`
    - If `TRUE`, keep the row
    - If not, discard it
- `filter(<condition>)` only returns the rows for which `<condition>` is `TRUE`
- Technical term for a statement that is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`: **boolean expression**

# TRUE/FALSE examples  

```{r}
3 > 2
3 < 2
3 == 2
c(1, 2, 3, 1) == c(3, 2, 1, 2)
c(1, 2, 3, 1) == 1
```

# Be careful with `NA`s!  

```{r}
1 == NA
NA == NA
is.na(NA)
```
